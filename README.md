# Hello-World
My first Repository
New to coding and can use some help. I live in California east of sacramento, I'v been trying to get two nrf24L01 to work together using RF24 libraries examples and modifying
them, with no luck. I'm trying to make what I thought would be a simple gate alarm and can't get them to cooperate.
